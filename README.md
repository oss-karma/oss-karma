# oss-karma

## goals

1. reduce the number of issues in aurelia repos
2. improve core documentation 

## secret goals
1. gamify oss contributions 
2. dominate the world
3. involve community

## means
1. aurelia app
2. serverless backend (firebase/auth firestore functions)
3. promition via github/Hanselman|blogs etc

## features
1. queues of issues that need clarification, repro instructions ets.. the time hogs for oss teams
2. queue of documentation requests
3. queue of issues on stackoverflow to be answered
4. karma points depending on level of contribution ranging from minor help to major contribution (team decides)
5. ability for oss teams to declare membership in oss_karma (ask for help)
6. app for github that allows to track karma contributions and assign points (rule based and|or manual)
7. possibility to reward for most contributions/month year (should not be only one.. or whoever is not john skeet will be demotivated. should be possible to win 2,3 places)


Idea is to allow community members to get involved.. a lot of documents describe that code is not the only way to contribute.
a place where one can easily start ones journey is not provided..

_chose a project_ is not the same as _here are some projects in need of your help_



that's a start
