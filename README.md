# oss-karma

## Premise
Many open source teams/projects have not enough time on their hands to do proper support/documentation.
With enough active users it is easy to offload triage of issues and documentation improvements to community.

Many issues are not actionable because they are not clear. Do not contain a clear repro. Investigating these takes time. And teams time is better spent on developing the product. That does hurt adoption though. And image in general. It is usually the case that there are enough people willing to donate their time to improve the situation. Stackoverflow clearly is an example.  
Most people just don't know how to contribute. Shy. Think that it is hard etc.

A tool that helps get that flow going could affect the whole industry.
One issue at a time. Make them actionable. So the team can take action. Better yet somebody else can create a PR.

## goals

1. reduce the number of issues in aurelia repos
2. improve core documentation 

## secret goals
1. gamify oss contributions 
2. dominate the world
3. involve community

## means
1. aurelia app
2. serverless backend (firebase/auth firestore functions)
3. promition via github/Hanselman|blogs etc

## features
1. queues of issues that need clarification, repro instructions ets.. the time hogs for oss teams
2. queue of documentation requests
3. queue of issues on stackoverflow to be answered
4. karma points depending on level of contribution ranging from minor help to major contribution (team decides)
5. ability for oss teams to declare membership in oss_karma (ask for help)
6. app for github that allows to track karma contributions and assign points (rule based and|or manual)
7. possibility to reward for most contributions/month year (should not be only one.. or whoever is not john skeet will be demotivated. should be possible to win 2,3 places)


Idea is to allow community members to get involved.. a lot of documents describe that code is not the only way to contribute.
a place where one can easily start ones journey is not provided..

_choose a project_ is not the same as _here are some projects in need of your help_



that's a start
